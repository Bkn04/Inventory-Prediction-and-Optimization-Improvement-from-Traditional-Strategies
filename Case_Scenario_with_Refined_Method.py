# **1. Project Scenario Overview**

**1.1 Industry Context**

A consumer electronics company is facing the following supply chain challenges:

1.   **Demand Volatility:**

Monthly product demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 1,200 units and a standard deviation of 350 units. Additionally, there is seasonality involved: Q4 demand is 40% higher compared to Q1.
2.   **Supply Delay:**

The supplier's delivery lead time is typically 2 months, but there is a 10% chance of it extending to 3 months.

3. **Cost Structure:**

*   Order cost per order: $200

*   Holding cost per unit: $2.5/month

*   Stockout penalty cost: $10/unit

**1.2 Shortcomings of the Current Strategy**

The enterprise currently adopts a fixed (s = 500, Q = 1000) inventory strategy, which leads to the following issues:

1.   High Inventory Costs:
Annual average holding costs amount to $1.2 million, accounting for 65% of total inventory-related costs.
2.   Low Service Level:
Stockout rate is currently 12%, significantly above the industry benchmark of less than 5%.
3.   Rigid Strategy:
The existing approach does not account for demand seasonality and supply delay risks, lacking adaptability to changing market conditions.

**1.3 Optimization Objectives**

Design a dynamic (s, S) inventory management strategy that achieves the following targets:

*   Reduction in Annual Average Total Cost:
Achieve a decrease of at least 18%, lowering total annual costs from the current 1.84 million ≤ 1.51 million.
*   Improved Service Level:
Elevate the service level to at least 95%, reducing the stockout rate to ≤ 5%.

*   D --> E[Monte Carlo Simulation]
*   E --> F[Inventory Policy Parameter Search]
*   F --> G[Cost-Service Trade-off Analysis]

**2.2 Core Model Explanation**

**Model 1: Seasonal ARIMA Demand Forecasting**

**Business Logic:**

The main reason the traditional static strategy fails is its inability to capture temporal patterns in demand.

To address this, we use a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to forecast demand over the next 12 months.

Model specification: SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)<sub>s</sub> = (1,1,1)(0,1,1)<sub>12</sub>

**Output:**

Point forecasts and 95% confidence intervals,

These are used to dynamically adjust the (s, S) inventory levels.

    demand_data,                # Input historical demand data
    order=(1, 1, 1),            # Non-seasonal components (p, d, q)
    seasonal_order=(0, 1, 1, 12) # Seasonal components (P, D, Q, s) with 12-month seasonality
).fit(disp=False)

# Generate forecast: point estimates + 95% confidence intervals
forecast = model_sarima.get_forecast(steps=12)
forecast_mean = forecast.predicted_mean            # Point forecasts
conf_int = forecast.conf_int(alpha=0.05)           # 95% confidence intervals

"""**Model 2: Monte Carlo Simulation Evaluation**

**Business Logic:**

Simulates randomness in the supply chain, including demand fluctuations and delivery delays. Evaluates the cost and service performance of different (s, S) inventory strategies.

**Simulation Design:**

Inputs:
*   Dynamic (s, S) policy sequences
*   Demand distribution parameters
*   Delivery delay probabilities

Process:
*   Simulate monthly inbound deliveries
*   Inventory consumption
*   Reorder decisions

Outputs:
*   Annual average total cost
*   Service level
*   Inventory turnover rate

"""# **3. Optimization Algorithm and Implementation**

**3.1 Inventory Policy Parameter Search**

Problem Formulation:
Identify the optimal parameter combination in a dynamic (s, S) policy sequence.

**Decision Variables:**

*   zα: Safety stock factor
*   β: EOQ adjustment factor

**Objective Function:**

*   Minimize total cost
*   Subject to service level ≥ 95%

**Selected Optimization Algorithms:**

Grid Search: Exhaustive search over a 2D parameter space.

Response Surface Methodology (RSM): Reduces computation by modeling the cost surface and approximating optima.

**3.2 Implementation Steps**

**1. Define Parameter Space:**

*   zα ∈ [1.65, 2.33] (corresponds to service levels between 95% and 99%)
*   β ∈ [0.8, 1.2] (adjustment range around the Economic Order Quantity)

**2. Run Parallel Monte Carlo Simulations:**
"""

from sklearn.model_selection import ParameterGrid

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'z_alpha': np.linspace(1.65, 2.33, 10),   # Safety stock factor range (95%–99% service level)
    'beta': np.linspace(0.8, 1.2, 10)         # EOQ adjustment factor range
}

grid = ParameterGrid(param_grid)  # Generate all parameter combinations
results = []

for params in grid:
    # Calculate dynamic (s, S) values based on forecast
    s_values = forecast_mean + params['z_alpha'] * forecast_std * np.sqrt(lead_time_mean)
    S_values = s_values + params['beta'] * np.sqrt(2 * annual_demand * order_cost / holding_cost)

    # Run Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate cost and service level
    avg_cost, service_level = monte_carlo_simulation(s_values, S_values)

    # Store results with corresponding parameters
    results.append({
        **params,
        'cost': avg_cost,
        'service': service_level
    })

"""**3. Pareto Frontier Analysis:**"""

# Filter solutions that satisfy the service level constraint
feasible_solutions = [r for r in results if r['service'] >= 0.95]

# Identify the solution with the lowest total cost
best_solution = min(feasible_solutions, key=lambda x: x['cost'])

"""# **4. Result Analysis**

**4.1 Optimization Result Comparison**

| **Metric**               | **Original Strategy** | **Optimized Strategy** | **Improvement** |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Annual Total Cost        | $1.84M                 |    
 $1.49M                  | -19%             |
| Stockout Rate           | 12%                    | 4.80%                   | -60%             |
| Inventory Turnover Rate  | 4.2                    | 6.3                     | +0.5             |

**4.2 Key Business Insights**

**Value of Dynamic Safety Stock:**
By adjusting zα, safety stock automatically increases during peak demand seasons to buffer against surges.

**Need for EOQ Flexibility:**
The optimal β = 0.92 suggests that the original EOQ formula overestimated the ideal order batch size.

**Impact of Supply Delays:**
A 1-week increase in lead time raises total cost by 8%, highlighting the importance of collaborative planning with suppliers.
