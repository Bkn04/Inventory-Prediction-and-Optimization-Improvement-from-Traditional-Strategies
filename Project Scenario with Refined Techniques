# Project Scenario Introduction

## 1.1 Industry Background

A consumer electronics company faces the following supply chain challenges:

- **Demand Fluctuation**  
  Monthly product demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 1200 units and a standard deviation of 350. There is also notable seasonality—Q4 demand is about 40% higher compared to Q1.

- **Supply Delay**  
  The supplier’s standard lead time is 2 months, but there is a 10% probability that it can extend to 3 months.

- **Cost Structure**  
  - Ordering cost per order: $200  
  - Holding cost per unit: $2.50 per month  
  - Shortage penalty cost per unit: $10
